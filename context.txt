The Great Wall of China is an ancient series of walls and fortifications located in northern China, built around 500 years ago during the Ming Dynasty in response to invasions from Mongol forces. It stretches over 13,000 miles and is one of the most iconic structures in the world, visible from space.

The wall served not only as a military barrier against invasions but also as a symbol of the power and perseverance of the Chinese people. Today, it is a UNESCO World Heritage site and a popular tourist destination, attracting millions of visitors each year who walk its storied paths and explore its historic watchtowers.
